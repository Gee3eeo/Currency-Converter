# CURRENCY CONVERTER

A currency converter is a device that facilitates the exchange of one currency for another. For instance, you would need to utilise a currency converter to change your US dollars into Euros if you were travelling to Europe from the United States. This project is a prerequisite to obtaining my ALX SWE (front-end) specialization program certificate.
